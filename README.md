Small demo.

Throw-away repository. Doesn't contain anything serious.

# Usage

Clone the repository. Run `yarn install` then `node index.js`.

Open https://polkadot.js.org/apps/ in your browser.
On the left, click on "Development", then "Local Node", and confirm with the "Switch" button.

You are now connected to Westend through substrate-lite.
